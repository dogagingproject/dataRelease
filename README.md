## Welcome to the Dog Aging Project Curated Data Release GitHub Repository.

 Within this repository, you will find the following sub-folders:  
 
| Sub-folder      | Description |
| :--- | :----------- |
| Codebooks      | CSV files containing variable names, survey question text, values, and value labels.       |
| Supporting_Documents   | Additional details pertaining to select datasets.        |
| Survey_Instruments   | PDFs of each survey instrument showing question text, gating logic possible responses, and variable names.        |

Please recall that there is a one year lag between curated data releases for the internal DAP
team and when these data become available to the public via open access releases. 
Due to this,
you may find files within these repositories that are not relevant for your situation.

Please refer to the README.txt files within each subfolder for further details on that folder's contents.
