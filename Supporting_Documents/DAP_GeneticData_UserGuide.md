## Dog Aging Project | Genetic Data User Guide

As part of the Dog Aging Project's nationwide, longitudinal effort to study the dynamics of aging in tens of thousands of companion dogs, we perform low-coverage whole genome DNA sequencing on a subset of the dogs in the study. The resulting dataset described in this guide enables the delineation of the genetic and environmental components of aging, longevity, health disorders, and age-related cognitive decline. The purpose of this document is to explain to users the structure of the genetic data and to provide background on how the data was obtained and analyzed prior to release. 

### Overview

The genomic data package contains genetic data derived from whole genome, low-coverage DNA sequencing and genotype imputation delivered on or before December 31st of current data release year, along with associated analysis files providing information regarding ancestry, inbreeding and phenotypic trait predictions.

### Sampling

Following cohort enrollment, a saliva sample kit is assigned to the dog and mailed to the participant's address by GBF, Inc., High Point, NC. The participant samples the dog using a DNA Genotek Performagene swab, and returns the sample kit via mail.

### Library preparation and sequencing

The sample kit arrives at Neogen Corporation - GeneSeek Operations (Lincoln, NE) for library preparation. Prepared libraries undergo short read, low-coverage Illumina DNA sequencing at their platform. 

### Alignment and imputation

Raw sequencing read data is imported by Illumina BaseSpace to the Gencove Platform for alignment and statistical genotype imputation using software *loimpute* by Gencove, Inc. (New York, NY). Sequencing reads are aligned to the CanFam3.1 reference genome assembly (NCBI accession GCF_000000145.2). Genotype imputation is performed using  *loimpute* and the dog low-pass v2.0 [0.1x-6x] panel of reference haplotypes, consisting of 34,191,821 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 11,943,064 insertions / deletions and representing 540 dogs of known breed ancestry distributed among ~133 breeds, 28 dogs of mixed breed ancestry, 12 dogs of unknown ancestry, 62 worldwide indigenous or village dogs, 33 wolves, and 1 coyote. Note this panel is used specifically during the imputation step; ancestry is determined at a later step using a panel optimized for ancestry inference. 

### Curation and assignment

Successful data deliverables migrate to a Dog Aging Project workspace on Terra.bio for curation and assignment to study IDs. For sequencing runs that do not reach quality needed for genotype imputation, only the raw sequencing reads (FASTQ files) are migrated. In the case of multiple samples per study ID, only genotyping data from the sequencing run with the higher effective genome coverage are assigned to the dog.

### Raw sequencing data

Raw sequencing read data (FASTQ files) are deposited to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under BioProject PRJNA800779. Sample IDs correspond to swab IDs (`swab_id`), not study IDs (`dog_id`).

### Genotyping data

Genotyping data (imputed variant calls) are released as a *PLINK1* bfile set containing filtered SNP genotypes. Sample IDs correspond to study IDs (`dog_id`).

### Genomic reports

The genomic reports are data derived and inferred from genetic data that are neither raw sequencing nor genotyping data. Sample IDs correspond to study IDs (`dog_id`).

## Methods

### Sex confirmation

We inferred the sex of each dog from aligned sequencing read data (BAM files) using *SAMtools* to measure the ratio of X chromosome coverage to autosomal coverage. Ratios over or equal to 0.7 were inferred as female, under 0.7 were inferred as male. We compared genetically-inferred sex to owner-reported sex given by the variable ss_dog_sex in the Health and Life Experience Survey (HLES). 

Confirmed sexes for each dog are reported as `sex` in file:
`DogAgingProject_GeneticData_CuratedRelease_XXXX.tsv`

### Filtering

Each variant call file (VCF) was filtered for calls of genotype probability above 70% (max(GP) > 0.7) using *BCFtools*. Sample IDs were converted from swab IDs to study IDs and genotyping data from multiple samples were merged in batches using *BCFtools*. Each merged VCF was converted to a *PLINK2* pfile data set (.pgen / .pvar / .psam) containing all variant calls (insertions, deletions, single nucleotide polymorphisms, multiallelic variants). Then, only biallelic SNPs were selected and converted to a *PLINK1* bfile data set (.bed / .bim / .fam). A final filtering step to include only SNPs with a minimum minor allele frequency of 1% and minimum genotype rate of 95% was applied. Confirmed sexes were encoded into this final *PLINK1* data set.

### Coefficients of inbreeding

We estimated coefficients of inbreeding as autozygosity, or the proportion of genome covered by runs of homozygosity (ROH). We scanned for ROH using *PLINK1* across the set of unfiltered biallelic SNP genotypes of genotype probability >70% with the following settings: minimum run length of 500kb (`--homozyg-kb 500`) and minimum SNP count of 100 SNPs (`--homozyg-snp 100`), at a density of 1kb per SNP (`--homozyg-density 1`), with no two SNPs more than 500kb apart (`--homozyg-gap 500`), and only 1 heterozygous genotype tolerated per window (`--homozyg-window-het 1`), performing scans without LD-based pruning on chromosomes 1-38 (`--chr 1-38`). All other settings were *PLINK1* defaults. We then calculated the autosomal ROH-estimated coefficient of inbreeding (F<sub>ROH</sub>, or CoI) from the total ROH segment length divided by the total SNP-covered autosomal length used for ROH detection.

Coefficients of inbreeding are reported as `coi` in file:
`DogAgingProject_GeneticData_CuratedRelease_XXXX.tsv`

### Genomic size prediction

We applied a random forest model developed on the Darwin's Ark (darwinsark.org) data set of 1,730 dogs with surveyed height phenotypes, coded as 0 = tiny, 1 = small, 2 = medium, 3 = large, or 4 = giant as assessed by dog owners, and 2,733 SNPs associated with canine height to predict body sizes (mean square error = 0.3).

Genomic size predictions are reported as `size` in file:
`DogAgingProject_GeneticData_CuratedRelease_XXXX.tsv`

### Global ancestry

We selected publicly available genotype data from 109 modern breeds with at least 4 dogs per breed, 3 regional village dog populations (4 Nigerian village dogs, 5 Vietnamese village dogs, 55 Chinese village dogs), and 2 wolf populations (19 North American wolves and 25 Eurasian wolves) (see *Populations* for full list of population labels and counts). We used *PLINK2* to identify ancestry-informative markers. We selected 4,267,732 biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms with <10% missing genotypes, and calculated the Wrightâ€™s F-statistics using Hudson method for (1) each dog breed versus all other purebred dogs; (2) all village dogs versus all other purebred dogs; (3) each regional village dog population; (4) all wolves versus all other dogs; (5) North American wolves versus Eurasian wolves. We selected 1,569,037 SNPs with F<sub>ST</sub> > 0.5 across all comparisons, and performed LD-based pruning in 250kb windows for r<sup>2</sup> > 0.2 to extract 115,427 markers for global ancestry inference.

We merged genotype data for these biallelic SNPs from query samples with genotype data from reference samples, then performed global ancestry inference using *ADMIXTURE* in supervised mode (random seed: 43) to infer ancestry from these populations. We report only admixture proportions over 1% for each dog.

The global ancestry inferred for each dog are reported in file:
`DogAgingProject_GeneticData_CuratedRelease_XXXX.ancestry.tsv`

### Genetic relationship matrix

We calculated the variance-standardized relationship matrix generated using *PLINK2* (`--make-rel`) across all autosomes.

The genetic relationship matrix is reported in file:
`DogAgingProject_GeneticData_CuratedRelease_XXXX.rel.tsv`

### Pairwise kinship

We applied the *PLINK2* implementation of the KING-robust estimator to measure kinship *k* between pairs of dogs from mixed populations. Relationships were either unrelated, and removed from the resulting table, or labeled as related (*k* > 0), second-degree (*k* >= 0.125), or first-degree (*k* >= 0.25). We apply a cutoff *k* >= 0.35 to identify duplicate samples. No data from duplicate samples are included in this release.

The relatedness for each pair of dogs are reported in file:
`DogAgingProject_GeneticData_CuratedRelease_XXXX.kinship.tsv`
