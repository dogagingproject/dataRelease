## Dog Aging Project | Treat Hide & Seek User Guide

### Overview

Treat Hide & Seek is a spatial memory task that assesses a dogâ€™s recall of the location of a food reward over longer and longer intervals. A schematic of the task setup is provided in Figure 1 (below).

The activity begins with a series of warm-ups in which the dog is introduced to the process of searching for treats in small boxes, positioned at two locations as indicated in Figure 1. Following this warm-up, the dog participates in a series of sixteen trials assessing spatial memory. On each trial, the dog and handler begin at a location equidistant from the two boxes where rewards will be placed (start location in Figure 1). A helper sits five feet away as indicated by the purple square in Figure 1. The helper places a treat in one of the two boxes. The dog is allowed to observe the baiting process. After a set amount of time, the handler releases the dog to search for the treat. 

- Delay for trials 1-4: 0 seconds 
- Delay for trials 5-8:	10 seconds 
- Delay for trials 9-12: 20 seconds 
- Delay for trials 13-16:	40 seconds 

After each trial, the dog is returned to the start position. The order in which the boxes are baited is counterbalanced across trials (occurring eight times at each location, following a predetermined order).

### About This Document 

This document provides an introduction to the Treat Hide & Seek dataset. Treat Hide & Seek is an at-home cognitive assessment presented to dogs in the DAP Pack annually. Owners are guided through the Treat Hide & Seek Activity in their personal research portal using a combination of written and video instructions.
